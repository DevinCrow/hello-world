My first Github Repository

Hello World!

This is my first ever post to Github. This year, I've decided to learn to code and to track my progress with Github. I have some basic experience with HTML and CSS from a class a took a couple years ago, but that's it. My first goal is to master HTML and CSS, then learn Javascript.
